# HackerRank Coding Challenges

This repo is for all of my HackerRank code challenges. Currently started a
personal challenge: 30 days of code!

## 30 Days of Code
At the start of 2017 I'm committing myself to 1 code challenge a day at least.

* Day 1: [Detecting Loops in
LinkedLists](https://github.com/snggeng/hackerrank/blob/master/hascycle.java)
